- ### Design
#### Color Scheme Used
Using a set of 4 colors to suit the outdoor nature theme of the company and highlight the images to their best advantage.
#### Font
Using Open Sans with a fall back to sans serif throughout the site for a clean modern look.
#### Imagery
The bulk of the images are my own. The testimonial images and the group image on the index page were sourced from www.unsplash.com 
I designed a company logo in Photoshop to add branding to the navbar and be able to highlight the brand throughout the site.


The website has been built using some bootstrap companents starting with the navbar.

### Wireframes

Designed wire frames for the site initially. Some of the layout has changed as I worked on creating the site and adapted as I felt might work best for the user.



Deployment to Github Pages

Opened ms1-tour-company repository in github. Clicked on settings, then clicked on pages and set to master and root. Saved and got a link. 

Found that my images were not working in the github pages link. Researched online for a solution. Found one but this then created a problem in gitpod with the images. Got in touch through the tutor pages and got hint to look at relative paths. Researched on this and went back to slack and between the two found that changing from // to / infront if the assets folder solved the issue.
