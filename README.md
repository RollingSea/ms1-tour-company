Welcome Guest!

This is the Rolling Hills Adventure Company Website ReadMe file. We are a small tour company based in the West of Ireland. On our site you can find out more about us, the places we love and the tours you can book with us. 

The website has been built using some bootstrap companents starting with the navbar.

Images used are my own and some from www.unsplash.com 

Designed Logo in photoshop for the company.

Deployment to Github Pages

Opened ms1-tour-company repository in github. Clicked on settings, then clicked on pages and set to master and root. Saved and got a link. 

Found that my images were not working in the github pages link. Researched online for a solution. Found one but this then created a problem in gitpod with the images. Got in touch through the tutor pages and got hint to look at relative paths. Researched on this and went back to slack and between the two found that changing from // to / infront if the assets folder solved the issue.
